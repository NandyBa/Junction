Today our protocol MVP is compatible with every EVM chain, polygon, Celo, cronos, Gnosis chain, Cosmos, Ethereum. Merger and acquisition are a way to make other communities and guild to come on their blockchain.

We can use a dispute resolution system, Kleros, to prevent / solve not planned issues.
